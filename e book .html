    <p>Far from the city's noise, in a quiet lab, Vikram was building his first invention. He didn't know that this invention would change his life forever. The sun's first rays were coming through the window, and a low hum was coming from the machine.</p>
    <p>His friend, Priya, entered the lab and smiled at Vikram. "You did it, Vikram!" she said.</p>
